\chapter{Asynchronous Handling} 

\section{Celery}
Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing.	It is focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling as well.
The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on a single or more worker servers using multiprocessing, Eventlet,	or gevent. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background) or synchronously (wait until ready).
\section{RabbitMQ}
Messaging enables software applications to connect and scale. Applications can connect to each other, as components of a larger application, or to user devices and data. Messaging is asynchronous, decoupling applications by separating sending and receiving data.
