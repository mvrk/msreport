\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
Using text-based interface(Unix-like Terminal, TBI) to manipulate computers can be very hard for normal people who don't have computer science related backgroud. Although TBI has some advantages, it have a steep learning curve for people to grasp in a short time. On the other hand, graphic user interface(GUI) provides a WYSIWYG feather, which makes people can directly work on their jobs without learning computer science knowledge first. This Teakwood framework is designed for that purpose.

\section{Teakwood}
Teakwood focuses on HPC jobs submission in computational science. Teakwood is a GUI framework that allows user to summit HPC jobs from Teakwood web console, and to have a full control of their projects. Teakwood migrates all the terminal typing work to Teakwood GUI, and wrap them with interactive web pages. This enables user to submit HPC jobs just by clicking functional buttons. No more terminal commands.\\
In Teakwood, all user's computing data are hosted in a file server. User can share their result, models and computing resources within their group. This greatly facilitated the collaborative work among users.\\
Teakwood also provides a project management system for user to organize their project data easily. \\
As Teakwood is a web framework, user can access from any where, any type of machine, as long as the machine has a browser and the Internet. no more hassle by the OS conflict.\\

\section{Features}
Functionally, Teakwood has the following features:\\

$\bullet$ \textbf{Perfect documentation}\\
Teakwood homepage provides diverse software documentations including installation guide, user manual, developer manual, video tutorial, etc. user can grasp Teakwood soon with document support.\\

$\bullet$ \textbf{Neat web portal}\\
A neat LSU style web console makes your job submission simple and easy. Drag, push and click, that's it. Let's say goodbye to terminal typing.\\

$\bullet$ \textbf{Job monitor system}\\
Job monitor system provides five labels: "uploading", "queued", "running", "finish", and "Data Ready" for user to read the job status. Job monitor system also periodically pulls the job running messages from computing server and displays them on working console, user may know more details.\\

$\bullet$ \textbf{Project management system}\\
All user's project data is well organized and web kept in a file server. user can compare, share, and download them as needed.\\

$\bullet$ \textbf{Powerful admin}\\
The powerful admin system is provided by Django itself. With tiny system configuration, user can activate their admin systems and have a top-down control of their accounts, machines, models and so on.\\

%$\bullet$ \textbf{Extensible development}\\
%Teakwood is loose coupling designed. User can add or remove features, models and python functions independently without mess the whole system.\\
